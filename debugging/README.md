# Bugs and Debugging

In this lab you will learn about:

- The difference between syntax errors and logic errors
- Various ways to debug your code 
- How to use debug50 in the CS50 IDE

## What are Syntax vs. Logic Errors?

Most of us encounter **syntax errors** at some point when creating a new program. Syntax errors prevent a program from successfully compiling and could include misspelled keywords, missing or misplaced curly braces, semicolon, parentheses, etc. 

If the compiler error message is hard to understand, we can prepend `help50` to `make hello` to get a bit more guidance on how to correct our error.

```
help50 make hello
```

On the other hand, when we encounter a **logical error**, our program usually compiles and runs, but gives us an incorrect result.
