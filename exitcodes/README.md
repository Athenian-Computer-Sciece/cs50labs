## What is an Exit Code?

You may have noticed that the `main()` function has a return type of `int`, yet we haven't been returning anything at the end of the main function.

It turns out that the compiler automatically returns 0 from our main function, if we don't specify anything. The value that is returned from our main function is called an **exit code**. As our programs get longer and more complex, these exit codes will become a valuable tool.
