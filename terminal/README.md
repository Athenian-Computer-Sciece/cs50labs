# Terminal

## What is the Terminal?

On the bottom of your window on the right is a "terminal window", which is a text-based or "command-line" interface to your workspace. The command line is very useful in programming because it allows you to explore your workspace's files and directories, compile code, run programs and even install software.

## Exploring your Workspace

Before we start, you may notive three text files open in the text editor on the upper right side of your screen. These files are located somewhere in your workspace, but are not stored in the appropriate folders. Just ignore these files for now.

Under the tab that says `>_ Terminal`, is a window with a `$` prompt. This is the window you will use to interact with your terminal. Let's start exploring this workspace.
