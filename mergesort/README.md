## What is Merge Sort?

Up until now, the three sorting algorithms we've looked at all have a worst case run time of O(n<sup>2</sup>). **Merge sort** is a fundamentally different kind of algorithm, with far superior running time, particularly for larger data sets. Merge sort works by recursively breaking an array into subarrays, then merging the subarrays back together.

To understand how this works, letâ€™s take a look at the following pseudocode:

```
if number of elements < 2
    return
else
    sort left half of elements
    sort right half of elements
    merge sorted halves
```
