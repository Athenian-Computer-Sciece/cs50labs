## What is Hexadecimal?

Earlier this year we learned about **number systems**. Specifically about the **binary** number system, which is how computers store data ranging from numeric values and ASCII characters to source code and images. Binary systems (which use base 2) store all data as 0's and 1's. We contrasted this to our everyday **decimal** number system (base 10) which uses ten digits, `0-9`. **Hexadecimal** is a numbering system which uses 16 symbols. In addition to the symbols `0-9`, we use `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`, for the higher values of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

In the same way as decimal numbers have place values that are powers of ten, and binary numbers use place values that are powers of two, hexadecimal numbers have place values that are powers of sixteen. So the hexadecimal number `0x13BA` (hexadecimal numbers are represented with `0x` in front of the value) would equate to 16<sup>0</sup> x A (which is 10) plus 16<sup>1</sup> x B (or 11) plus 3 x 16<sup>2</sup> plus 1 x 16<sup>3</sup> which is 10 + 176 + 768 + 4096. Added up, these total to 5050.
