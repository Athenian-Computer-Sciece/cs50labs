## What is Hexadecimal?

When we learned about how computers use binary to store data, we talked about **number systems**. Specifically about the **binary** number system. How we have been taught all our lives to use the **decimal system** (base 10), where we have ten digits, 0-9. We learned how computers use the **binary**, which is base 2, and uses two digits, 0 and 1. **Hexadecimal**, base 16, is another number system that is often used to represent digital data. Since hexadecimal numbers use 16 digits, the values 0-9 are used for the first ten digits, and the characters A-F are used for the remaining six.

In the same way as decimal numbers have place values that are powers of 10, hexadecimal numbers have place values that are powers of 16.
