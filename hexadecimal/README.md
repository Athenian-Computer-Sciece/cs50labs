## What is Hexadecimal?

Earlier this year we learned about **number systems**. Specifically about the **binary** number system, which is how computers store data ranging from numeric values and ASCII characters to source code, and images. Binary systems (which use base 2) store all data as 0's and 1's. We contrasted this to our everyday **decimal** number system (base 10) which uses ten digits, `0-9`. **Hexadecimal** is a numbering system which uses 16 symbols. In addition to the symbols `0-9`, we use `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`, for the higher values of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.


and how it compares to the **decimal system** (base 10).  where we have ten digits, `0-9`. We learned how computers use the **binary**, which is base 2, and uses two digits, `0` and `1`. **Hexadecimal**, base 16, is another number system that is often used to represent digital data. Since hexadecimal numbers use 16 digits, the values `0-9` are used for the first ten digits, and the characters `A-F` are used for the remaining six.

In the same way as decimal numbers have place values that are powers of 10, hexadecimal numbers have place values that are powers of 16.
