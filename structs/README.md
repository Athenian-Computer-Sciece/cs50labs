# Structures and Encapsulation

In this lab you will learn:

- What structs are
- How we create and use structs

## What is a Struct

There are times that we want to store data that is related, but of different data types, in one variable. This bundling of data is called **encapsulation**. In other programming languages, we might do this with an **object**, but in C, we have something that's more basic: the **data structure** or just **struct**.
