# Data Types

## What is a Data Type?

A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. A `string` can hold only textual data, while an `int` can only hold a whole number.

Some of the data types you will use in CS50AP are native data types, meaning they are built into the C language, and others are made available to you in the CS50 Library, which you can use by typing

```
#include <cs50.h>
```

at the top of your program.
