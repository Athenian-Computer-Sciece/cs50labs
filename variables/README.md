# Variables

## What is a Variable?
In computer programming, a variable is a container that holds a numbers, words, or other types of data to use in your program. Variables in programming are similar to variables in those you use in math class, since they both represent a value, but unlike variables in math, variables used in programming do not represent an "unknown", and has a value that can change.

Another difference is in variable names. In math, variables are only one letter long, as in x, or y, or n. While in most programming languauges, variable names can be a single letter, they can also be a word or phrase (as long as there are no spaces). It's considered good programming practice, to use variable names that represent the data they are being used to store. For instance, you might store your name in a variable `name`, and your age in a variable `age`. You can combine multiple words with underscores, such as `student_name`, and `teacher_name`. But if you try to name a variable `student name`, your program won't understand what you want it to do.
