# Syntax

## What is Syntax?

In linguistics, syntax is the set of rules for using words, phrases and punctuation to form sentences. If the word order of a sentence was incorrect, you might not understand what is being said to you. For instance, 

```
Science is comprehensive to a computer CS50 introduction
```
might not make a lot of sense to you if you speak English. But

```
CS50 is a comprehensive introduction to computer science
```

probably does!

In **Computer Science**, syntax is also important for a computer to undersand what you are telling it to do. Each programming language has it's own syntactical rules, which include the combination of words, and punctuation.

For instance, to say "hello" in C, we would write:

```c
printf("hello,  world\n");
```
