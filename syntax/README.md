# Syntax

## What is Syntax?

In linguistics, syntax is the set of rules for using words, phrases and punctuation to form sentences. If the word order of a sentence was incorrect, you might not understand what is being said to you. For instance, 

```
Science is comprehensive to a computer CS50 introduction
```
might not make a lot of sense to you if you speak English. But

```
CS50 is a comprehensive introduction to computer science
```

probably does!

In **Computer Science**, syntax is also important for a computer to undersand what you are telling it to do. Each programming language has it's own syntactical rules, which include the combination of words, and punctuation.

For instance, to say "hello" in C, we would write:

```c
printf("hello,  world\n");
```

Here we are using a function, `printf` which takes an argument `"hello, world\n"` is wrapped in symmetric parentheses, `(` and `)`.

Since the argument, or parameter, that `printf` takes is a `string`, or sequence of characters, (a datatype you will learn more about soon!) the characters are surrounded by double quotes, `"`.

And finally, the entire line ends with a semicolon, `;`, which new programmers like us need to remember to include, but which will come more naturally with practice!
