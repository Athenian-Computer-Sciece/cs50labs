# Functions

In this lab you will learn:

- What is a function
- Why programmers use functions
- How to write your own function in C

## What is a Function?

Since the first program we wrote together, we've been using functions! These were functions that were given to us, that we didn't have to create ourselves, such as `printf()`, `get_int()`, etc.

These functions were written by programmers many years ago, and are made available to us so we don't have to constantly recreate the wheel! We are able to use these functions over and over again. This points to one key reason why programmer use functions, which is **reusability**. 

Imagine what programming would be like if we had to recreate `printf()` every time we wanted to output something to our terminal window! It would take forever to complete the simplist program! 

The other key reason that programmers use functions is **abstraction**. To use `get_int()` for instance, we need to know 
* The name of the function
* What the function does
* What arguments to give to the function
* What kind of result the function returns

One thing we **don't** need to know is **how the function works inside**! You don't have to know anything that goes on inside of the function.

We can write our own functions as well! Once we've taken the time to program and debug your function, we can use it over and over again in multiple programs. Using functions, our code becomes **simpler**, more **organized**, and **easier to debug**!
